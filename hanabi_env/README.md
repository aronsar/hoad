The Hanabi Learning Environment was taken from the following project: https://github.com/deepmind/hanabi-learning-environment.

hanabi\_learning\_environment is a research platform for Hanabi experiments. The file rl\_env.py provides an RL environment using an API similar to OpenAI Gym. A lower level game interface is provided in pyhanabi.py for non-RL methods like Monte Carlo tree search.
